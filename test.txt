p wcard 5 6 100
c note the p line need not be the first line
c the magic hard marker 100 should be higher than
c all the soft costs
12 1 2 3 0
c a soft clause (cost = 12 < hard cost = 100) with
c three variables a,b,c >= 1, hence terminated by a 0
99 4 5 0
c another soft clause with cost 99
100 1 2 3 4 5 <= 1
c a hard clause, because the magic cost = 100c ’at most’ one of the variablesc a,b,c,d,e can be true.
100 -1 -2 -3 -4 -5 >= 4
c another hard clause (100) exactly the samec clause as before, but stated
c as an ’at least’ constraint
c because all SAT clauses are ‘at least 1’, we can
c now see that this hard clause correctly
c contradicts the soft clauses, as we would expect.
3 1 2 3 4 = 1
c an exactly soft clause, can be split into 2 clauses line so
c 3 1 2 3 4 >= 13
1 -2 -3 -4 >= 3
