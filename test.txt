p wcard 5 6 100
c this specifies A=5 variables, B=6 clauses, and C=100 for hard clause prefixes
c note C needs to be more than sum of all soft costs
c note the p line need not be the first line
12 1 2 3 0
c a soft clause (cost = 12 < hard cost = 100) with three variables a,b,c >= 1 (terminated by a 0)
99 4 5 0
c another soft clause with cost 99
100 1 2 3 4 5 <= 1
c a hard clause, because the magic cost = 100c ’at most’ one of the variablesc a,b,c,d,e can be true.
100 -1 -2 -3 -4 -5 >= 4
c another hard clause (100) exactly the same clause as before, but stated
c as an ’at least’ constraint
c because all SAT clauses are ‘at least 1’, we can
c now see that this hard clause correctly
c contradicts the soft clauses, as we would expect.
3 1 2 3 4 = 1
c an exactly soft clause, can be split into 2 clauses line so
c 3 1 2 3 4 >= 13
1 -2 -3 -4 >= 3
